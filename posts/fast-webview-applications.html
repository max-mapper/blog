      <p>Embedded mobile <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIWebView_Class/Reference/Reference.html">WebViews</a> have
        bad default behaviors that result in slow applications. To help fix the
        bad defaults I started some new libraries, <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/ViewKit">ViewKit</a> and
        <a
        href="https://github.com/maxogden/masseuse.js">masseuse.js</a>, and found some helpful libraries written by others. Additionally,
          all of the specific things covered in this article have associated code
          examples available in <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/fast-webview-applications-presentation">https://github.com/maxogden/fast-webview-applications-presentation</a>

<h1 id="why-not-go-full-native">Why not go &quot;full native&quot;?</h1>

      <p>Having been recently tasked with writing <a href="https://gather.at/">an iPhone application</a> I
        found myself at a fork in the road. Going down the path of Objective-C
        meant diving head first into a painful world of static typing, subclassing,
        IDEs, closed source frameworks and cultish fanaticism. The other path,
        JavaScript and HTML5, is one I have been working with every day for years.
        For me the natural choice would be to work with the tools I knew best,
        but I also recognized that most developers who write iPhone applications
        choose Objective-C so there would be a lot (see: tons) of rough edges along
        the road less traveled.</p>
      
<h1 id="cordova">Cordova</h1>

      <p>I ended up using <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/cordova/">Cordova</a> (formerly
        PhoneGap). The name Cordova comes from <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/HLRM">the street</a> in
        Vancouver, Canada that was home to the software developers who built the
        framework, but the project's goals actually remind me a lot of the Spanish
        city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3rdoba,_Andalusia">Cordoba</a> (Cordova
        is actually the English form of Cordoba according to Encyclopedia Britannica).
        Around 1000 years ago Spain was filled, like much of pre-enlightenment
        western Europe, with people who got all of their information from the church.
        Then Muslims from northern Africa started moving into southern Spain and
        spread their ideology: to seek knowledge through science. Cordoba quickly
        became the most incredible city in the world with paved streets, street
        lights (gas powered), public hospitals, universities, medical schools,
        restaurants and the world’s largest library.</p>
      <p>The whole Objective-C vs JavaScript debate is a modern version of what
        happened in Spain back in the day. Then: The church delivered the facts
        and you weren't encouraged to modify them. Now: Apple delivers SDKs and
        developers aren't allowed to modify them. Then: Cordoba made giant leaps
        and bounds due to a culture of open science. Now: JavaScript has created
        of the <a href="https://github.com/popular/watched">largest</a> open source
        projects and <a href="http://www.modulecounts.com/">fastest growing</a> package
        repositories.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Contemporary Muslims who bring up the memory of Cordoba typically do so
          either to emphasize the need for a new Islamic scientific and industrial
          renaissance, or to emphasize the need for a multi-cultural and tolerant
          society.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>— <a href="http://www.el-baghdadi.com/projects/the-islamic-paradigm/56-cordoba-victory-over-christianity.html">via</a>
      </p>
      <p>Cordova gives you a nice platform to build HTML5 iOS apps on top of. Essentially
        Cordova wraps a full screen WebView in a native app 'container' so you
        get nice things like the ability to call from JavaScript into Objective-C
        to do things like send and receive <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iOS/PushNotification">push notifications</a>,
        <a
        href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.7.0/cordova_media_capture_capture.md.html#Capture">take photos</a>, integrate with SDKs (<a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iOS/Twitter">Twitter</a> and
          <a
          href="https://github.com/davejohnson/phonegap-plugin-facebook-connect">Facebook</a>for example), etc. At the end of the day, though, most of
            your time will be spent working on the HTML, CSS and JS that runs in that
            WebView. The harsh reality is that where Apple ships both the platform
            and the UI framework together, Cordova is just the platform. You are expected
            to BYOUI.</p>
      <p>Even though Cordova implements the same <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.7.0/index.html">core JS API</a> across
        many platforms many mobile developers will tell you a bigger issue is that
        WebKit is turning into the new Internet Explorer: huge <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2012/05/16/android-fragmentation-visualized-opensignalmaps/">fragmentation in the Android market</a> and
        a we-do-whatever-we-want attitude at Apple means it's not realistic to
        expect the code that runs in a WebView on iOS5 to run on iOS4 or an Android
        browser. Because of these issues I decided to first target iOS5 and then
        port to other platforms later.</p>
      <p>There are a few big frameworks for iOS like <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> and
        <a
        href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch">Sencha Touch</a>but having built web apps with them in the past I always
          felt too constricted by their monolithic approach. Instead, I prefer a
          small modules loosely joined approach.</p>
      
<h1 id="touch-events">Touch Events</h1>

      <p>The first thing you'll want to do is speed up your clicks. By default
        in WebViews there is a ~300ms delay if you are responding to <code>click</code> events.
        This is for capturing certain gestures like double tap to zoom in. Since
        we are in a viewport controlled unzoomable application container we don't
        actually want this behavior but sadly there is no easy way to disable this
        and make clicks fast again. <code>touch</code> events, on the other hand,
        have no artificial delay. Google has offered up <a href="https://developers.google.com/mobile/articles/fast_buttons">one solution to this problem</a> but
        I find their approach requires tight coupling between events and DOM elements.
        Rather than having a 1:1 ratio between DOM elements and their associated
        event listeners I instead use a few global listeners that aren't tightly
        coupled to any specific DOM elements.</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/maxogden/masseuse.js">masseuse.js</a> is a
        library I wrote that includes all of the touch related helpers (in a less
        contrived form than this post) that I developed while working on my application.</p>

        </video>
      </p>
      <p><i>Strange default behavior.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The numbers shown are a rough calculation of the time between when the
        user's finger touches the screen to when the associated <code>click</code> event
        finishes firing.</p>
      <p>Beyond the click delay there are also certain CSS properties enabled in
        WebViews that can create a confusing UX (as you can see in the above video).
        Here's a rundown (via the <a href="http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/16494795/iPhone%3A%20Prevent%20callout,%20link%20selection,%20text%20auto-resize">PhoneGap wiki</a>):</p>
<pre><code data-language="css">* {
  /* prevent callout when holding tap on links (the native dialog that comes up) */
  -webkit-touch-callout: none; 

  /* prevent webkit from resizing text to fit */
  -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; 

  /* make transparent link selection, adjust last value opacity 0 to 1.0 */
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0,0,0,0);

  /* prevent copy paste, to allow, change &#39;none&#39; to &#39;text&#39; */
  -webkit-user-select: none; 
}

// turn off webkit checkbox style, works for other inputs too
input[type=&quot;checkbox&quot;] { -webkit-appearance: none; }

// placeholder text opacity
input::-webkit-input-placeholder { opacity: .8; }</code></pre>

      <p>To fix slow touches you must turn off <code>click</code> events for each
        kind of element that needs to be fast:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript">$(&#39;a&#39;).live(&#39;click&#39;, function(e) {
  e.preventDefault()
  return false
})</code></pre>

      <p>To replace clicks you can use the <code>tap</code> abstraction from zepto.js
        to handle touch events:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript">$(&#39;a&#39;).live(&#39;tap&#39;, handleTaps)</code></pre>

      <p>Since we are disabling <code>click</code> we are also throwing away the
        native behavior that we get from <code>click</code> events (focus for inputs,
        href changes for anchor tags, checkbox checking, etc) so we will have to
        re-implement that behavior in javascript. To implement this for anchor
        tags in a very rudimentary way:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript">function handleTaps( event ) {
  window.location.href = $(event.currentTarget).attr(&#39;href&#39;)
}</code></pre>

<h1 id="zepto">Zepto</h1>

      <p><a href="http://zeptojs.com/">Zepto</a> is a jQuery API compatible library
        designed specifically for WebKit so it is smaller and much more easy to
        read because it doesn't aim to support every weird browser under the sun.
        It also has some nice mobile specific modules like <a href="https://github.com/madrobby/zepto/blob/master/src/gesture.js">gesture</a> and
        <a
        href="https://github.com/madrobby/zepto/blob/master/src/touch.js">touch</a>.</p>
      
<h1 id="templating-and-routing">Templating and Routing</h1>

      <p>Client side templating is good for mobile apps, as you wouldn't want to
        fetch remote templates over a wireless connection.</p>
      <p>There are a ton of templating and routing engines out there, so you can
        pick whichever one you like! I happen to use mustache.js and director.js
        because they are nice and simple. Here's a simple example:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript">// render a template and insert it into the dom
function render( template, target, data ) {
  target = $( target ).first()
  target.html( buildTemplate(template, data) )
}

// gets templates out of hidden &lt;script&gt; tags in the DOM:
function buildTemplate(template, data) {
  return $.mustache( $( &quot;.&quot; + template + &quot;Template&quot; ).first().html(), data || {} )
}

var routes = {
  cats: function() {
    var cats = [&#39;aristotle.png&#39;, &#39;bikecat.png&#39;, &#39;awesomecat.gif&#39;, &#39;walkingcat.png&#39;, &#39;seriouscat.png&#39;]
    render(&#39;gallery&#39;, &#39;.content&#39;, {pictures: cats})
  },
  dogs: function() {
    var dogs = [&#39;hellodog.png&#39;, &#39;shopdog.png&#39;, &#39;bearddog.png&#39;, &#39;coco.png&#39;]
    render(&#39;gallery&#39;, &#39;.content&#39;, {pictures: dogs})
  }
}

// Router is provided by Director
Router({
  &#39;/&#39;: {
    on: function() { window.location.href = &quot;#/cats&quot; }
  },
  &#39;/:page&#39;: { 
    on: function(page) {
      routes[page]()
    }
  }
}).init(&#39;/&#39;)</code></pre>

      <p>
        <video preload="none" poster="/media/templating.jpg" controls>
          <source src="/media/templating.m4v">

        </video>
      </p>
      <p><i>The above code in action.</i>
      </p>
      <p>To get the fixed header and nice scroll behavior of the content div in
        the above: as of iOS5 you can use CSS to assign native scroll behavior
        to a DOM element:</p>
<pre><code data-language="css">.content { -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; }</code></pre>

      <p>To get this behavior on pre-iOS5 WebViews you have to use JS libraries
        like <a href="http://cubiq.org/iscroll">iScroll</a>. I personally have found
        most of these libraries to be very clunky to work with.</p>
      
<h1 id="sprites-and-retina-images">Sprites and Retina Images</h1>

      <p>When testing on device I noticed significant latency when loading images
        from the filesystem. Given the following CSS, when you tap on an input
        it will focus before the image loads and appears, which makes the app feel
        slow.</p>
<pre><code data-language="css">input { background-image: url(&#39;images/text.png&#39;) }
input:focus { background-image: url(&#39;images/text-focus.png&#39;) }</code></pre>

      <p>
        <video preload="none" poster="/media/nosprite.jpg" controls>
          <source src="/media/nosprite.m4v">
            <source src="/media/nosprite.ogv">
        </video>
      </p>
      <p><i>Image load time in the simulator. On actual devices it is even more noticeable.</i>
      </p>
      <p>If you look closely at the icons in the input fields you'll see that they
        are grainy, as the simulator in that video is simulating a retina display.
        To support retina devices I would have to have a copy of each CSS rule
        inside of a media query:</p>
<pre><code data-language="css">@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {
  input { background-image: url(&#39;images/text@2x.png&#39;) }
  input:focus { background-image: url(&#39;images/text-focus@2x.png&#39;) }
}</code></pre>

      <p>This isn't very maintainable as it would double the amount of CSS required
        to show images. Instead, I create sprites using the glue utility:</p>
<pre><code>glue images/ . --simple --algorithm=vertical</code></pre>

      <p>This will give me a single sprite png as well as CSS rules based on the
        filenames of the original images from within the sprite, so now my CSS
        looks like this:</p>
<pre><code data-language="css">.sprite { 
  background-image: url(sprite.png);
  background-repeat:no-repeat;
}
.sprite.text { background-position:0px 0px; }
.sprite.text:focus { background-position:0px -40px; }

@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {
  .sprite {
    background-image: url(&#39;sprite@2x.png&#39;);
    background-repeat:no-repeat;
    background-size: 40px 160px;
  }
}</code></pre>

      <p>Now I don't have to re-define each element with a sprite inside of the
        media query -- I only need to swap out all elements with a <code>sprite</code> class
        on them with the retina sprite. The small caveat here is that I have to
        add the <code>sprite</code> class to each element in the markup that uses
        a sprite for it's background image:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; class=&quot;text sprite&quot; value=&quot;&quot; placeholder=&quot;Name&quot;&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>
        <video preload="none" poster="/media/sprite.jpg" controls>
          <source src="/media/sprite.m4v">
            <source src="/media/sprite.ogv">
        </video>
      </p>
      <p><i>With the retina sprite enabled. Again, on an actual device the improvement is much more noticeable.</i>
      </p>
      <p>There are lots of WebView quirks not related to performance that I will
        save for another blog post.</p>
